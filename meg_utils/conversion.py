  """
  Convert a FIF file to an EDF file using pyedflib.

  This function reads an EEG data file in FIF format using MNE-Python and converts it to EDF format using pyedflib.
  Optionally, a subset of channels can be selected for conversion.
  Stimulus events are extracted and included as annotations in the EDF file.

  Parameters
  ----------
  fif_file : str
      Path to the input FIF file.
  chs : list or None, optional
      List of channel indices or names to include in the EDF file. If None,
      a default set of channels is selected automatically. Default is None.
  edf_file : str or None, optional
      Path to the output EDF file. If None, the output filename is the same as
      the input filename with '.edf' appended. Default is None.

  Returns
  -------
  None

  Notes
  -----
  This function uses MNE-Python to read the FIF file and pyedflib to write the EDF file.
  Stimulus events are extracted from the 'STI101' channel and included as annotations.
  Channels are normalized using z-score normalization before writing to the EDF file.

  Examples
  --------
  Convert a FIF file to EDF format:

  >>> fif2edf('sample.fif')

  Specify channels to include:

  >>> fif2edf('sample.fif', chs=[0, 1, 2, 'STI101'])

  Specify output EDF filename:

  >>> fif2edf('sample.fif', edf_file='output.edf')
